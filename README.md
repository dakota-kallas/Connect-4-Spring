# Connect-4

The Connect 4 project is an implementation of the classic Connect 4 game as a web application using the Spring & Angular framework. This application should function identically to my other project, <a href="https://github.com/dakota-kallas/Connect-4" target="_blank">Connect 4 (Express)</a>, only this project uses a Spring backend along with MongoDB rather than a non-persistent Express backend. The goal of this project is to provide a fun, interactive, and user-friendly platform for players to enjoy the game on the web.

## Gameplay

Connect 4 is an online multiplayer game that challenges players to strategically place their tokens on a 5-row by 7-column grid to create a line of four consecutive tokens. The game alternates between the player and the computer, with each player taking turns to drop their tokens into a single column. The objective is to be the first player to connect four tokens in any direction, horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

The game features an interactive interface that makes it easy for players to drop their tokens into the grid. The tokens slide downward to occupy the lowest non-occupied row of the selected column, allowing for strategic placement. The game also features real-time updates, so players can see the status of their opponent's moves and react accordingly.

This project is designed to be fast, reliable, and engaging. Whether you're a seasoned Connect 4 player or just starting out, this online version of the classic game is sure to provide hours of fun and excitement.
